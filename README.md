# LendingClubCaseStudy

The Lending Club facilitates online loans for individuals. One major challenge the company faces is the risk of borrowers defaulting on their loans, leading to credit losses. Borrowers who fail to repay their loans cause financial losses, which the company aims to minimize. Identifying risky loan applicants is crucial for reducing the likelihood of defaults and protecting profits.
